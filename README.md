# Ruby Interview Questions

A curated collection of Ruby and Rails interview questions, answers, and runnable examples.

This repository is organized to help learners and interviewers quickly find high-quality prompts, canonical answers, and small runnable snippets that demonstrate key Ruby and Rails concepts.

Top-level layout
- `questions/` — categorized prompts (beginner, intermediate, advanced, rails)
- `answers/` — canonical answers in Q&A format that mirror the `questions/` structure
- `examples/` — small runnable Ruby and Rails example scripts (snippets and Rails-patterns)
- `docs/` — contribution guide, style and question format

Quick start — run examples
These examples are plain Ruby files and can be run without Rails or extra gems.
