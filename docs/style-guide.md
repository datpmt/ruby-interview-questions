# Style guide

Keep questions and answers readable and reviewable.

Writing tips
- Use short, simple sentences. Prefer active voice.
- Keep answers focused: provide a short direct answer first, then a short explanation, then optional examples.
- Use fenced code blocks for examples and prefer minimal, runnable snippets.

Code examples
- Aim for dependency-free Ruby code for the `examples/snippets/` folder. If demonstrating Rails behavior, include a note about Rails version and any setup required and put the file in `examples/rails/`.
- Add a small runner (`if __FILE__ == $0`) when useful so examples can be run directly.

Naming and filenames
- Use snake_case for filenames (e.g., `blocks_procs_lambdas.md`).

Review checklist
- Is the question clear and unambiguous?
- Does the answer provide a direct response plus explanation?
- Are examples minimal and runnable where possible?
